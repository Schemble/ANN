    "## Summary\n",
    "In this exercise you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "* train MLPs and for both classification and regression problems\n",
    "* overfit models and see how overfitting changes validation performance\n",
    "* avoid overfitting using regularization\n",
    "* do model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 11 questions in this exercise. These 11 questions can be found in five different cells below (see the section \"The Different Cells\"). All of the exercises deal with training and evaluation of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. You are going to work with different datasets, binary and multiple classification problems and function approximation problems. For all questions, except the last two ones, the code is available that you can run directly or only need to make small modifications to. For the last two questions, we only provide a small part of the code, and you should provide the rest. However, it is typically just a matter of paste and copy from the previous code cells (in a proper way).\n",

    "## The data\n",
    "There are several datasets in this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "### syn1 - syn3\n",
    "Three different synthetic classification problems will be used. They are all 2D binary classification problems which allow for an easy visual inspection of the different classes and the decision boundary implemented by the network. They are called *syn1, syn2* and *syn3*. Each of these datasets is generated \"on the fly\" each time. They come from various normal distributions. Since they are generated using random numbers, it means that each time you generate the data, it will be slightly different from next time. You can control this by having a fixed *seed* to the random number generator. The cell \"PlotData\" will plot these datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### regr1\n",
    "There is also a synthetic regression problem, called *regr1*. It has 6 inputs (independent variables) and one output variable (dependent variable). It is generated according to the following formula:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad d = 2x_1 + x_2x_3^2 + e^{x_4} + 5x_5x_6 + 3\\sin(2\\pi x_6) + \\alpha\\epsilon$  \n",
    "    \n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is added normally distributed noise, and $\\alpha$ is a parameter controlling the size of the added noise. Variables $x_1,...,x_4$ are normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance, whereas $x_5, x_6$ are uniformly distributed ($[0,1]$). The target value $d$ has a non-linear dependence on ***x***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spiral data\n",
    "This is the \"famous\" spiral dataset that consists of two 2-D spirals, one for each class. The perfect classification boundary is also a spiral. The cell \"PlotData\" will plot this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Japanese vowels dataset\n",
    "*This data set is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Japanese+Vowels].* In short, nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels /ae/ successively. For each utterance, a discrete times series was produced where each time point consists of 12 (LPC cepstrum) coefficients. The length of each time series was between 7-29. \n",
    "Here we treat each point of the time series as a feature (12 inputs). In total, we have 9961\n",
    "data points which then has been divided into 4274 for training, 2275 for validation and 3412 for the test. The original data files are provided as *ae.train* and *ae.test*. The task is now based on a single sample value of one of the speakers, determine which speaker it was. This is, in summary, a 9-class classification problem with 12 input values for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The exercises\n",
    "There are 11 questions, where the first five questions are dealing with 2D binary classification problems. Here you will be able to see the boundary implemented by the different MLPs that you train. Questions 6-9 deals with training a regression network for the *regr1* dataset. Here you are also going to use regularization to \"combat\" overtraining. Question 10 is the Japanese vowels classification problem, where your task is to come up with a model that optimizes the validation result. Finally, the last exercise is to find a model that can solve the spiral problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The different 'Cells.'\n",
    "This notebook contains several cells with python code, together with the markdown cells (like this one) with only text. Each of the cells with python code has a \"header\" markdown cell with information about the code. The table below provides a short overview of the code cells. \n",

    "For you to start with the exercise, you need to run all cells with the cell type \"Needed.\" The very first time you start with this exercise we suggest that you enter each of the needed cells, read the cell instruction and run the cell. It is important that you do this in the correct order, starting from the top and work your way down the cells. Later when you have started to work with the notebook, it may be easier to use the command \"Run All\" found in the \"Cell\" drop-down menu.\n",

    "\n",
    "From now on we will talk about *performance*! It can be the performance of a trained model on the training dataset or the performance on the validation dataset. What do we mean by performance?  For classification problems, we will provide four different measurements as returned by a call to the *stats_class* function. They are:\n",

    "Here you are going to train a classifier for the *syn2* dataset. You are also going to use a validation dataset as an estimate of the *true* performance. Since we generate these datasets, we can allow for a relatively large validation dataset to get a more accurate estimation of *true* performance. The default value in the cell is to generate 1000 validation data points. \n",

    "**Hint:** Overtraining here often means finding a good local minimum of the error function, which may require some tuning of the learning parameters. This means that you may have to change the learning rate, increase the number of epochs and use \"better\" minimization methods. Even though we have not yet talked about the *Adam* minimization method, it is generally better than vanilla *stochastic gradient descent*. It is therefore used in the cells below as the default minimizer. Also, you may want to change the size of the \"batch_size\" parameter. It is by default using all data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 4\n",
    "The effect of overtraining can be monitored by looking at the validation performance. **(a) When you overtrained in the previous question, how much much did the validation *loss* increase, compared to the linear model of Q2?** **(b) What is the optimal number of hidden nodes for the syn2 dataset to maximize your validation performance?** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 5\n",
    "Now you are going to use the *syn3* dataset. So, use **150** training data points from the synthetic dataset 3 and train an MLP to separate the two classes. Also, use about 1000 data points for validation. By looking at the data, one would expect to need at least three hidden neurons to separate the two classes. **Why?**\n"

    "Now we are going to look at a regression problem. The data as described above (regr1) consists of 6 inputs (features) and one output (target) value. As for previous examples, a new data set is generated each time you call the *regr1* function. To get the same dataset between different calls, use a fixed seed. New for this problem is that one can also control the amount of noise added to the target value. We are going to use a relatively small training dataset (~250) and a larger validation dataset (~1000) to get a more robust estimation of the generalization performance. For regression problems, we also need new performance measures. The *stats_reg* function will give you two such measures:\n",
    "* MSE = mean squared error (low error means good performance)\n",
    "* CorrCoeff = Pearson correlation coefficient for the scatter plot between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below can be used as a template for all questions regarding this regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 6\n",
    "Use 250 data points for training and about 1000 for validation and **no** added noise. Train an MLP to predict the target output. If you increase the complexity of the model (e.g., the number of hidden nodes), you should be able to reach a small training error. You will also most likely see that the validation error decreases as you increase the complexity or at least no clear sign of overtraining. **Even though the validation error is most likely still larger than the training error why do we not see any overtraining of the model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As with previous examples you may need to tune the optimization parameters to make sure that you have \"optimal\" training. That is, increase or decrease the learning rate, possibly train longer times (increase *epochs*) and change the *batch_size* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 7\n",
    "Use the same training and validation data sets as above, but add 0.4 units of noise (set the second parameter when calling the *regr1* function to 0.4 for both training and validation). Now train again, starting with a \"small\" model and increase the number of hidden nodes as you monitor the validation result for each model. **How large model do you need to see overtraining?** Make a note of the validation error you obtained this point!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 8\n",
    "Instead of using the number of hidden nodes to control the complexity it is often better to use a regularization term added to the error function. You are now going to control the complexity by adding an *L2* regularizer (see the \"INPUT\" dictionary in the cell). You should modify this value until you find the \"near optimal\" validation performance. The number of hidden nodes should at this point be larger than the number found in the previous question. **Give the L2 value and the number of hidden nodes you found to give \"optimal\" validation performance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 9 \n",
    "**Summarize your findings in a few sentences.**"

    "For this exercise, you are given a classification problem with a fixed training-, validation- and test dataset. The data is the Japanse vowels dataset described in the first cell. Your task is to do a model selection, coming up with your optimal MLP architecture together with the hyperparameters you used. We do not provide any python code for this question, only the small part that reads the data (next code cell).

    "The typical goal is to have a high accuracy (i.e., the fraction of correctly classified cases). During training, we typically monitor possible overfitting by looking at the log loss of the validation data, since this is the error used during training. One can, however, have a situation where the log loss increases for the validation data but the accuracy does not decrease (why?). This means that monitoring the accuracy may be better during the model selection. This can be accomplished by *plt.plot(estimator.history['acc'])* and *plt.plot(estimator.history['val_acc'])*.\n"
